STRACE:

First I need to know if it is an ELF file, more precisely is it a 64 or a 32 ?
Second, I need to exec the file and catch all signals receive and print it.
Third at each syscall, handle it depending on it's context (64 or 32).

CRITERIA:

read lenght of elf header and cast it into structures. Now we can know if it is
an ELF an/or 64 or 32.

- file does not exist <OK>
- file cannot be read <OK>
- file is not an elf  <OK>
- file is not a 64|32 <OK> 

PATH:

strace can (if needed) create the path for the binary.

strace /bin/ls
strace ls -> strace /bin/ls

RUNNING:

Depending on the context of the binary, signal will be handled the same way,
but not the syscall. so each binary will have a function pointer assigned to it.

Difference between SEIZE and ATTACH is that ATTACH by default will sigstop the proccess, seize will not.

FINAL:

ft_strace should print the syscall name, his parameters and the return call.

BUGS

perror has a problem with getenv, always return success even tho the var foesnt exist in the environment.
